# Travel Spot Ranking

## Overview
This project ranks travel spots based on various factors, using data science and machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about different travel destinations, including location, popularity, ratings, and reviews. The goal is to build a ranking model that helps travelers choose the best destinations based on data-driven insights.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation using machine learning algorithms
- Accuracy assessment and performance metrics
- Geospatial processing using `geopy`
- Visualization of results with charts and graphs

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Geopy for geospatial analysis
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for implementation

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install specific libraries manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn geopy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TravelSpotRanking-Final.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the cells step by step to process the data, train the model, and visualize results.
3. Analyze the ranking output and performance metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of travel spots with attributes like:
- **Location**: Latitude and Longitude
- **Popularity Score**: Based on online reviews and ratings
- **Number of Reviews**: Total reviews for a travel spot
- **Average Rating**: Aggregate user ratings
- **Category**: Type of travel destination (e.g., beach, historical site, nature reserve)

## Results
The project evaluates the ranking model using different machine learning techniques and compares their performance based on accuracy and other metrics. The final ranking output provides insights into the best travel spots based on data analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more travel-related factors such as weather, local events, and accessibility.
- Implement a recommendation system for personalized travel suggestions.
- Use deep learning techniques for better ranking predictions.
